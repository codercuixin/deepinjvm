Probing what VM modes are available:
 (failures are non-fatal, but may miss some interesting cases)

----- [OK] [-Xint]
----- [OK] [-XX:TieredStopAtLevel=1]
----- [OK] [-client]
----- [OK] [-client, -XX:-TieredCompilation]
----- [OK] [-server]
----- [N/A] [-server, -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions, -XX:+StressLCM, -XX:+StressGCM]
Error: Could not create the Java Virtual Machine.
Error: A fatal exception has occurred. Program will exit.
Error: VM option 'StressLCM' is develop and is available only in debug version of VM.


----- [OK] [-server, -XX:-TieredCompilation]

 (all failures are non-fatal, but may affect testing accuracy)

----- [OK] Adding ourselves to bootclasspath: D:\IdeaProject\deepinjvm\src\main\java\test\target\jcstress.jar
----- [OK] Unlocking diagnostic VM options
----- [OK] Trimming down the number of compiler threads
----- [OK] Trimming down the number of parallel GC threads
----- [OK] Trimming down the number of concurrent GC threads
----- [OK] Trimming down the number of G1 concurrent refinement GC threads
----- [OK] Testing @Contended works on all results and infra objects
----- [OK] Unlocking Whitebox API for online de-optimization
----- [OK] Testing allocation profiling
----- [FAILED] Trying Thread.onSpinWait
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: java.lang.Thread.onSpinWait()V
	at org.openjdk.jcstress.vm.ThreadSpinWaitTestMain.main(ThreadSpinWaitTestMain.java:30)


Burning up to figure out the exact CPU count....... done!

  Hardware threads in use/available: 4/4, no yielding.
  Test preset mode: "default"
  Writing the test results to "jcstress.1571042860377"
  Parsing results to "results/"
  Running each test matching ".*" for 1 forks, 5 iterations, 1000 ms each
  Each JVM would execute at most 5 tests in the row.
  Solo stride size will be autobalanced within [10, 10000] elements, but taking no more than 100 Mb.
